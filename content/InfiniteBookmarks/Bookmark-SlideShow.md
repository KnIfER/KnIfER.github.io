Not really slide show, but keyboard shortcut, used to quickly navigate back and force inside of a bookmark folder.  

This feature frees you from clicking again and again on the side panel or popup window.   

<kbd>Alt+2</kbd> for next.  <kbd>Alt+1</kbd> for previous. After having clicked a bookmark or temporary bookmark in this extension, you can use those two shortcut to navigate.

I further use AutoHotkey to remap "clicking on the right edge of screen" as <kbd>Alt+2</kbd>.

You can also use "zero memory tabs" when you needs to open large folder, but don't want to crash computer RAM.
